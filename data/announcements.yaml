    Dr. Marlene Kanga — the President-Elect of the World Federation of Engineering Organizations
    — recently discussed the lack of equal representation for women in engineering in the United States at a 
    UN Commission in March.
    <br />
    However, the Society of Women Engineers has helped make huge strides by continually working to balance out 
    the field, and to contribute, AffordableColleges.com has created a resource that is a collection of 
    scholarships specifically for women — including a dedicated section of scholarships for women in STEM.
    <br />
    Find resources for scholarships, including special varieties such as scholarships for minority women, 
    scholarships for female veterans, and references to STEM grants
