#     Dr. Marlene Kanga — the President-Elect of the World Federation of Engineering Organizations
#     — recently discussed the lack of equal representation for women in engineering in the United States at a
#     UN Commission in March.
#     <br />
#     However, the Society of Women Engineers has helped make huge strides by continually working to balance out
#     the field, and to contribute, AffordableColleges.com has created a resource that is a collection of
#     scholarships specifically for women — including a dedicated section of scholarships for women in STEM.
#     <br />
#     Find resources for scholarships, including special varieties such as scholarships for minority women,
#     scholarships for female veterans, and references to STEM grants
