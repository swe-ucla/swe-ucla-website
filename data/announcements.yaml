    image: 
    subtitle: November 27th – December 1st
    description: "Mental Health Awareness Week is a new initiative from the Society of Women Engineers to shed 
    light on issues on the issues we as engineers––and members of the broader UCLA community––may face during 
    our four rigorous years here. Through our five-day series packed with events and engaging workshops, we hope 
    not only to destigmatize issues surrounding mental health and illness, but also educate you about ways to 
    effectively combat them. We hope to see you throughout the week!"

    Dr. Marlene Kanga — the President-Elect of the World Federation of Engineering Organizations
    — recently discussed the lack of equal representation for women in engineering in the United States at a 
    UN Commission in March.
    <br />
    However, the Society of Women Engineers has helped make huge strides by continually working to balance out 
    the field, and to contribute, AffordableColleges.com has created a resource that is a collection of 
    scholarships specifically for women — including a dedicated section of scholarships for women in STEM.
    <br />
    Find resources for scholarships, including special varieties such as scholarships for minority women, 
    scholarships for female veterans, and references to STEM grants
