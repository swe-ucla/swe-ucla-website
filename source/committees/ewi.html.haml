    %p
      The EWI committee is responsible for the planning and logistics of
      #{link_to 'Evening With Industry', '/swe/events/ewi'} - the largest student-run networking event
      on campus. Under the guidance of our Internal and External EWI Co-Chairs, each committee member
      is given a specific role with important responsibilities that are crucial to EWI's success.
