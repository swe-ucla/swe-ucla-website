        %p 
            The EWI committee is responsible for the planning and logistics of #{link_to 'Evening With Industry', '/events/ewi'} - the largest student-run networking event on campus. Under the guidance of our Internal and External EWI Co-Chairs, each committee member is given a specific role with important responsibilities that are crucial to EWI's success.
